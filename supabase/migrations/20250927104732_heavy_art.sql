*/

-- Insert admin user (this will be handled by Supabase Auth)
-- The actual user creation needs to be done through Supabase dashboard or API

-- For now, we'll create a simple approach using the existing auth system
-- You can sign up with: admin@solarnaija.store / admin123

-- Note: In production, you should create the admin user through Supabase dashboard
-- and use proper role-based access control
